# Born2beroot
This project aims to introduce us to the wonderful world of virtualization.

### What is Born2beroot?
Born2beroot is an individual project at [42](https://www.42sp.org.br/) that requires us to create a virtual machine with an [SSH server](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell), firewall rules, an operating system [monitoring script](monitoring.sh), and, as a bonus, the installation of [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) and a service like [FTP](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol) or [DNS](https://www.cloudflare.com/pt-br/learning/dns/what-is-a-dns-server/). The operating system can be either Debian or CentOS.
